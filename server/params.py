  this is a parallel function to abort (provided by bottle.py) so use
  accordingly. however, it raises HTTPResponse, and so will NOT be
  caught by other handlers - it's just a clean exit.

  """Decorator: Basic request verification for json REST endpoints
  
  Checks that the request is valid json, that the json returned is an
  object (since lists can lead to XSS attacks and are discouraged in
  json apis) and that all the keys in `keys` are present in the request.
  
  In strict mode, the request is not allowed to have extraneous keys
  that aren't present in `keys` or `opts`.
  
  Most requests will want to be strict, I can't imagine why you would
  want a non-key (required field), non-opt (optional field) parameter
  in the request you're making. What other kinds of fields are there?
  However, leaving the option here for the time being - it might be useful
  to relax the requirement while developing and the keys aren't finalized.
  
  This function will pass through the named keys and opts through to the
  wrapped function BY NAME.
  If you say `@params(['x'])`, you will have to define a parameter named
  `x` in your function:
  
  ```python
  @params(['x'])
  def take_x(x):
    pass
  ```
  
  The keys/opts are passed as keyword-args, so they can occur in any order
  in your function signature.
  
  Note that the params passed through the JSON request will CLOBBER
  kwargs the function is called with.
  
  So if you have a route param, don't have an expected JSON param of the same
  name (again, why on earth would you want this)
  
  This is BAD:
  
  ```python
  @route('/test/<x>')
  @params(['x'])
  def f(x):
    pass
  ```
  
  You will never see the x value from the route.
  This function will throw an error if there's an overlap, so that you can't
  do that by accident.
